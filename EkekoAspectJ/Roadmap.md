#Roadmap

A roadmap for damp.ekeko.aspectj 

## To Do

* Find a name for this sucker
* * Proposal: AASCI: Automated Aspectual Source Code Inspection. Pronounce it: Awe-ski :-)

* (CDR) Have walks over call graph work.
* (CDR) Make annotations on aspects and advice work.
* (CDR) Tool support: highlight in editor, inspect AST nodes.
* (JF) Go over the whiteboard rules and check.
* * Complete precedence for a shadow
* * Overriden implicit precedence for a shadow
* * Wormhole: read-write, read-write-percflow + combine with soot analysis
* * refinement of abstract PC semantics
* * Recheck the inclusion semantics 
* (JF) Implement rules in mail of 20 sept.
* (JF) Execution levels rules.
* (JF) Exceptions problems rules.
* Some persistent store, to  catch evolution issues: store old values of X before a compile and after a compile see changes in X.

## Done
* ~~(CDR) Simplify UI WRT Soot et al, using the configure menu item on a project.~~
* ~~(CDR) Have the test framework work~~
* ~~(CDR) Fix soot aspectJ build dependency~~
* ~~(CDR) Test suite: extra parameter that indicates if soot nature has to be enabled for the test.~~
